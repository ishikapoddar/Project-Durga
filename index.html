        <strong>Women's empowerment (or female empowerment) </strong> may be defined in several ways, including
        accepting women's viewpoints or
        making an effort to seek them, raising the status of women through education, awareness, literacy, and
        training. Women's empowerment equips and allows women to make life-determining decisions through the different
        problems in society. They may have the opportunity to redefine gender roles or other such roles, which in turn
        may
        allow them more freedom to pursue desired goals.

        Women's empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in development and economics. Economic
        empowerment
        allows women to control and benefit from resources, assets, and income. It also aids the ability to manage risk
        and
        improve women's well-being. It can result in approaches to support trivialized genders in a particular political
        or
        social context. While often interchangeably used, the more comprehensive concept of gender empowerment concerns
        people of any gender, stressing the distinction between biological and gender as a role. Women empowerment helps
        in
        boosting the status of women through literacy, education, training and awareness creation. Furthermore, women's
        empowerment refers to women's ability to make strategic life choices which had been previously denied them.

        Nations, businesses, communities and groups may benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that
        adopt the
        notion of female empowerment. Empowerment of women enhances the quality and the quantity of human resources
        available
        for development. Empowerment is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing human rights and
        development.

        <p class="wiki">
            The UN Security Council will be meeting at the UN Headquarters in New York on 21 October, to discuss the
            women, peace
            and security agenda, as the world remains in a state of crisis, almost two years into the COVID-19 pandemic.

            Violence, conflict, political and humanitarian crises have displaced 82.4 million people from their homes;
            115 million
            people are living in extreme poverty; and 100 million do not have enough to eat – up from 77 million last
            year.
            Around the world, from Afghanistan, to Ethiopia, to Myanmar, women’s human rights defenders have come under
            attack and
            the wave of political violence against women in politics and media has risen. <br><br>

            Against this backdrop, women continue to be under-represented in COVID-19 response and other decision-making
            fora,
            although women’s labour – paid and unpaid – and their leadership in communities keep families and nations
            running. Women
            made up only 25 per cent of members in the COVID-19 task forces in 36 conflict and post-conflict countries.

            The Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund has demonstrated how direct support to women leaders and
            organizations makes a
            difference. Yet, in the wake of the pandemic, they are in dire need of funding. In the meantime, global
            military
            expenditures rose 2.6 per cent in 2020, reaching almost USD 2 trillion, outpacing pandemic-related health
            spending. <br><br>

            The UN Secretary-General’s 2021 report on women, peace, and security issues an urgent call for action to
            reduce military
            spending and to increase investment in peacebuilding, education, health and other public programmes.
            Reversing the
            upward trajectory in military spending is a priority for the women’s movement for peace and a core
            commitment of the
            United Nations. The UN peacekeeping operations accounts for only 0.3 percent of global military spending,
            and places a
            stronger focus on delivering on women, peace and security commitments.

            Led by the Government of Kenya, the Security Council Open Debate on Women, Peace and Security, on 21
            October, will focus
            on investing in local women peacebuilders – a key strategy to deliver on these commitments. The evidence is
            clear:
            women’s participation in peacebuilding generates more buy-in from communities and makes peace more durable.
            <br><br>

            With more than 153 signatories, the Women, Peace and Security and Humanitarian Action Compact that was
            launched in July
            2021 at the Generation Equality Forum, provides further impetus and action to finance and promote women’s
            leadership and
            agency across peace, security and humanitarian sectors.

            As governments, humanitarian actors, and peacebuilders from Colombia to Afghanistan meet at the UN this
            week, watch this
            space for news, updates and voices of women peacebuilders.
